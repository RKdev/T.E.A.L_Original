The Extensible Adaptable Learning Framework

This is a pet project I've been wanting to work on for years. The idea is a learning management system focused around self-study.

I originally conceived of the idea as a way of managing how to read all the books I have. As I played around with it, I decided I wanted
to extend the concept to more than just library books to any kind of resource, ie. youtube videos, online classes, wikipedia articles, etc.
From a usage standpoint I want to try and combine the usability of Pinterest
with the spaced-learning system in Anki.

I'm also using this project as a learning platform for web development in general. It contains a tiny node.js instance for learning server-side code.

I should mention that this is a giant work-in-progress and will probably be broken half the time. My goal is to have a working beta of
the system up by March.
